# üß¨ Protein Alignment Search Challenge

### Overview
You are provided with:
- A **query protein sequence** (e.g., a newly discovered protein), and  
- A **database of 100 protein sequences** (template proteins).  

Your goal is to identify which template(s) best match the query sequence using sequence alignment techniques.

---

## üß† Task Description

### Your Task
1. **Implement either:**
   - **Needleman‚ÄìWunsch (Global Alignment)**, or  
   - **Smith‚ÄìWaterman (Local Alignment)**  

   You may choose *one* algorithm. Your implementation must be correct, efficient, and clearly explained in your code.

2. **Compare the query with each of the 100 template sequences.**
   - Use a **similarity matrix** (provided) to calculate alignment scores.  

3. **Compute the alignment score** for each query‚Äìtemplate pair.

4. **Normalize your alignment scores** by alignment length:
   \[
   \text{Normalized Score} = \frac{\text{Alignment Score}}{\text{Alignment Length}}
   \]

5. **Measure the total computation time** required to align the **query sequence against all 100 templates**.  
   - Record this time in seconds (or milliseconds).  
   - You may use Python‚Äôs built-in `time` or `timeit` module.

6. **Identify and report the Top 3 best-matching sequences** based on normalized scores.

## üìÇ Input Format
- Input files are provided in **FASTA format**:
  - **query sequence**.
  - **100 template sequences**.

### üîπ FASTA Reading Note
You **may use Biopython** to read FASTA files.  
Example:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO

query = str(next(SeqIO.parse("query.fasta", "fasta")).seq)
templates = [str(rec.seq) for rec in SeqIO.parse("templates.fasta", "fasta")]
```
---
### ‚öôÔ∏è Rules and Notes
Do not use any prebuilt alignment libraries (e.g., Bio.pairwise2, Bio.Align, parasail, or SeqAlign).

You may use standard Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and csv.

Implement gap penalties explicitly (e.g., gap_open = -5, gap_extend = -1).

The similarity matrix file will be provided ‚Äî do not hardcode BLOSUM62 or any external matrix by name.

Ensure your implementation can handle variable-length sequences without crashing.

Include clear comments and docstrings explaining the purpose of each function and variable.

Proper normalization of scores is mandatory before ranking templates.

Your code must report total runtime for the full query vs. all 100 templates.

---

### üßæ Expected Output Format

The output should be a structured table that includes alignment results and runtime.

| Template ID | Raw Score | Normalized Score |
|--------------|------------|------------------|
| Template_01 | 246 | 1.92 |
| Template_45 | 230 | 1.78 |
| Template_23 | 224 | 1.72 |

At the end of the output, print the total compute time and the query-template alignment for the best-fit template only.

### Deliverables

Each submission must include the following files: Your final code implementation (.py or .ipynb) and the output file (.txt or .docx)
